Want to make your apps on your start menu go from looking like this:
<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/mail.png" width="350" title="Old Style">
</p>
<br>
To this?
<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/discord.png" width="350" title="New Style">
</p>

Using Start Icon Changer, you can make this happen! Simply head over to the releases page and download the most recent version.

You will need to extract the files from the zip and run the exe from there.
